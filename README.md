## About the project

Recreated famous probabilist Montecarlo Algorithm for a final university subject project. 
Made a visual and a non-visual version. Developed on C# both of the versions.

### How it works
As i said, there is a visual and a non visual version. Both do the same, calculate pi with 
Montecarlo Algorithm.

#### Non Visual

With the non-visual version, we can see how if we increment de balls thrown on the circle 
(each iteration that we can see on the video), the results go each time closer to pi. With
this, we can understand easily how as we increment the balls thrown, it easier is for the Algorithm
to calculate pi.

#### Visual

On the other hand, the visual mode allows us to understand how the calculation is made on
the back. And how the balls are thrown so we can calculate pi with a probabilist
method.
